# Easy i18n Tutorial Source

This project is meant to be used in conjunction with the 
[Easy i18n](https://github.com/awkay/easy-i18n) Library.

The example will work best on a system that supports Bash shell scripts,
since it uses those to make the process of extracting, merging, and
compiling the translations easier.
